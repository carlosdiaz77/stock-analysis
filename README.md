# ** VBC for the Stock Market**

## Overview of Project.

-This project was the challenge for module 2 of the Data Analysis  Bootcamp  Texas University At Austin
The objective was to  develop macros in excel using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)
The final result was to be able to refactor the code and impove the time the macro takes to run the code.

-In this project  we  use real data of 12  clean energy companies that are in the US stock market
We had data of their stock prices of the years 2017  and 2018

VBA_Challenge_2017

## Results

- The macro creates a table where we can see data of the 12 different tickers such as Total Daily Volume, and the return of investent  either in 2017 or 2018

- A VBA macro was created. It  can trigger pop-ups and inputs, read and change cell values, and format cells.
- For-loops and conditionals to direct logic flow were used
- Nested for loops were also utilized
- Coding skills such as syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging were developed in this challange.
- Arrays were created
- Code was refactored to improve the execution time of the macro.





## Summary

- I had the opportunity to make some tables and graphs and I could get some interesting insights from them.
- Generally speaking I had to pay special attention to every line in the instructions, If you don't do this you can miss an important instruction and have an incomplete task in the challenge.
